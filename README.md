A Smart Library System is an innovative project aimed at enhancing the efficiency of library management using modern technologies. The system automates key functions like book tracking, inventory management, user registration, and borrowing processes through a user-friendly interface. It integrates features such as RFID-based book identification, QR codes, or barcode scanning for faster checkouts and returns. Additionally, the system can include automated notifications for overdue books, real-time search capabilities, and digital access to e-books and resources. This mini project aims to reduce manual tasks, streamline operations, and improve the overall user experience within libraries, providing a smart solution for traditional library challenges.
